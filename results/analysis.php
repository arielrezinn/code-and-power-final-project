        <h1>Analysis of Data</h1>
        <div class="container">
            <p style="text-indent:30px">Our survey was designed to allow people to compare their answers against those of their peers rather than assigning survey takers an overall score. As such, on our results page we display users’ results side by side with the average answer from our peers so that way it provides easy means of comparison.</p>
            
            <p style="text-indent:30px">Additional considerations we made while developing our survey were to not record the amount of time it takes users to complete the survey as well as not providing a “neutral” response option for survey takers.</p>
            
            <p style="text-indent:30px">In implicit bias tests, time is a major factor in someone’s overall score; however, we chose not to time responses and survey duration because we believe that the amount of time it takes to complete the survey is not reflective of an individual’s understanding of ableism as it pertains to their own life. The amount of time it takes to answer a given question or complete the entire survey is dependent on the participant’s mood, cognition, environment, ability, and many other factors. As such, we believe that time would be an inaccurate metric for this survey; however, we still ask survey takers to answer each question as quickly and accurately as possible in order to gain a sense of any implicit biases.</p>
            
            <p style="text-indent:30px">Many alternatives to the implicit bias tests have neutral options; however, we chose not to have a neutral option in order to force survey takers to think critically and confront these tough questions honestly. We felt that giving people a neutral option would give them an easy out if they were uncomfortable with their true answer.</p>
            
            <p style="text-indent:30px">In our survey, we asked multiple questions regarding the visibility of people with disabilities in the media. Many survey respondents said that they rarely saw people with these disabilities in the media. It shows that people with these disabilities are not usually mentioned in the media and survey respondents are relatively unfamiliar with them. It is also possible that people with disabilities are visible in the media but people pay less attention to and are unaware of them. Either way, there should be more representatioon of disabled people.</p>
            
            <p style="text-indent:30px">We also asked questions surrounding common situations that people with disabilities face and found that many of our survey respondents rarely experience the same struggles of accessing medication or medical care or even having to hide aspects of oneself to seem more “employable.” Finally, we asked questions surrounding one’s experience with accessibility accommodations and we found that while many people do not take accommodations into consideration while purchasing from a business or posting on social media, many of our survey respondents said they benefited from the same tools and technologies that are used to improve accessibility, such as having captions on videos. Overall, the survey results have shown that many people benefit from increased accessibility, but the subject is often forgotten about due to its lack of representation in the media. By taking this survey, we hope that students (most of whom are entering the tech sector in the near future) will be cognizant of and develop products with accessibility at the very core.</p>
            
            <p style="text-indent:30px">People with disabilities are as underrepresented on the web as minorities who Noble mentioned in Algorithms of Oppression (p.138), "information science has inherited and continues biased practices in current system designs, especially on the web." In the context of accessibility of websites, websites have not been designed to fulfill the needs of people with disabilities. Without further education or attention to such topics, people with disabilities will continue to be underrepresented on the web. Most of us who take this class are Computer Science majors and eventually workers in the tech industry. Some of us might be web developers. It is crucial to stop the biased design of websites and strengthen people's awareness of accessibility, especially those of us who will design the webs in the future. </p>
            
            <p style="text-indent:30px">There were also a number of individual questions with results worth discussing. The first of those is question one, "How often do you see disabled people as inspiring?" At the time of this writing, the average result is "Somewhat Often." The problem with this lies in the concept of inspiration porn, which can be described as objectifying disabled people for personal inspiration instead of seeing them as another individual with their own thoughts, feelings, ideas, and inherent worth. (For more information on inspiration porn, visit our resources page) Able-bodied neurotypical people often have minimal exposure to disabled people, and the exposure that does occur is often in the form of "motivational speakers" in schools and misrepresentation in media. This contributes to the objectification of disabled people. This question's data supports the idea that inspiration porn exists, and most people aren't aware of the inherant problem with it</p>
            
            <p style="text-indent:30px">Another question that deserves individual analysis is question 15, “How often do you benefit from videos being captioned?” At the time of writing, the average response to this question is “Often”. This question is interesting when put into context of the global pandemic. Would this answer be different if we hadn’t had the pandemic? The pandemic forced many students to consume online learning materials more than they had previously ever. It’s plausible that students’ exposure to asynchronous lecture recordings created more awareness for the importance of video captioning. Captions are growing in popularity recently in social media as well, which has been beneficial for all users. It’s not uncommon to see TikToks with automatically produced captions or text to speech. Other social media platforms, such as Instagram stories, have followed TikTok’s lead. All of these recent changes likely played a role in the average response of “Often”.</p>

            <p style="text-indent:30px">We chose the topic of accessibility because we thought that it was something that is extremely important to be aware of when developing yet have been surprised that it is not covered much (if at all) in any of the courses we have taken so far at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. As such, our group utilized this project as an opportunity to increase our familiarity with the subject and learn more about what we can do as developers in order to have in impact so that way we are cognizant of the things we can do as we enter the workforce and develop consumer-facing products.</p>

            <p style="text-indent:30px">Since our project’s focus was on ableism and accessibility, we wanted to make sure that our survey itself was as accessible as possible, so we did our best at adhering to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) AA standards throughout every aspect of our website. In addition to making our website clean and easy to navigate, we also wanted it to be fully accessible through keyboard navigation. In order to do this, we put large amounts of thought into the color scheme of our project, a clean design, and utilizing technologies like focus indicators to draw attention to interactive content.</p>

            <p style="text-indent:30px">A goal of our survey was to bring awareness to ways in which people with disabilities may be overlooked in society. This is especially relevant in the tech industry, as was discussed in week six’s lecture, because of the false belief of meritocracy and the tendency for “hacker culture” to prioritize and elevate white cis men without any visible disabilities. We hope that our survey inspires our users to not perpetuate this culture that minimizes voices from marginalized groups, especially as many people taking this survey will end up in the tech industry.</p>

            <p style="text-indent:30px">The main difficulties we faced as a group resulted from our decision to edit our website purely using the file manager and editing tools built into the hosting site. Primarily we faced difficulties editing portions of the website at the same time, having to discuss when we planned to edit a file so as to not overwrite a different group member’s work. This issue was exacerbated by the fact that many components of our site were interconnected in a way that made it difficult to change one component without affecting another. We also didn’t have some of the features that are available in moden IDEs. For example, we lacked debugging and autocompletion in the browser editor. We also struggled at times to figure out meeting times that worked with all of our schedules. Additionally, we had issues dividing up the work for the site because of how connected all of the components were. All of our issues were resolved relatively smoothly because of how successfully we were able to communicate as a group. However, if we had opted to use version control software we may not have run into these issues.</p>
