            <h2>Paired programming session</h2>
            <p>I think the paired programming session worked well. My partner was Ariel and she clearly has much more experience in web development. She suggested using a live-server plugin in VSCode instead for the website, which is really time-saving and easy to do. I learned a lot from her.</p>
            <h2>Group Project</h2>
            <p>The group work session provided me a chance to collaborate with these enthusiastic, smart, kind people. Charles is the absolute beast for coding. He's so energetic in every aspect and detail of the project. Ariel's so passionate about our project and the topic and always comes up with new ideas on designs. She puts so much effort to make the website accessible. Michael's thoughtful and he often gives a good call on something, always willing to give his best to work. I feel thankful and grateful for this opportunity. Before doing this project, I actually have almost zero awareness or knowledge about ableism and the difficulties of people with disabilities. During the time making this project, I had friends sharing information on a disabled teacher unable to get a teaching certificate because of some rules that are made without considering the rights of people with disabilities. From that moment, I noticed that the lack of accessibility of people with disabilities is a worldwide problem, not just in the states. During the project, we faced difficulties. It’s hard for us to do version control. It’s difficult to split tasks. I had tons of work stuck in the last few weeks which caused time conflicts with other group members. But we come through. I think it is just how online collaboration works.</p>
            <h2>The Course</h2>
            <p>The course overall is inspiring. From meritocracy to bias in search algorithms, it covered so many topics and content I have never discussed before. In the very first discussion, Professor Royston said to me about the "pipeline" issues. From here, I learned how to view racism and sexism from a different angle throughout the course, namely a historical and systematic perspective. Beforehand, I usually consider things on the first level but never take a deeper look at many events. Moreover, I would like to offer some suggestions: first of all, this course should be more available to students who are majoring in tech-related majors. We discussed a lot on racial and gender disparities in the tech industries, but the discussions are more on the “how” basis. By that I mean we are analyzing the existing disparities. In order to change these disparities, it is necessary to make more people aware of these disparities, especially those who will enter the industry in the future. The second suggestion is on the course itself. It will be great if instructions on assignments will be more clear. Sometimes they are confusing. Finally, it would be fantastic if Professor can host an office hour every week, or host a real-time discussion periodically. The open discussion we have now is text-based, which is a little bit plain.In conclusion, I liked this course a lot and I would definitely recommend this course to my friends.</p>
